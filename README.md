## Design Structure

This portfolio is built with a modern web development structure:

- **HTML:** The foundational structure is created with semantic HTML5 to ensure accessibility and SEO optimization. Each section of the portfolio is well-defined to provide user-friendly navigation.

- **CSS:** I used custom CSS rules to style the components of the portfolio. Color themes and styles are implemented using CSS variables, making it easy to switch between different themes. I employed **Flexbox** to create responsive layouts, allowing the content to adapt seamlessly on all devices.

- **JavaScript:** To enhance interactivity, I implemented a theme toggler and a weather display function that fetches data from a weather API.

### Color Scheme

The portfolio design utilizes the following colors:

- **Background Color:** #ffffff (white for light theme), #0e1627 (dark blue for dark theme)
- **Text Color:** #333333 (dark gray for light theme), #ffffff (white for dark theme)
- **Accent Colors:** #f9c740 (yellow for buttons and hover effects)
